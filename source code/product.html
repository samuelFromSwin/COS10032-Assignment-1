    <h1>EZ-Accounting Service Range</h1>
    <p>
        EZ-Accounting is a simple online helper for small businesses. It uses basic artificial
        intelligence to help you keep track of money coming in and going out. Instead of typing
        every detail into a notebook or spreadsheet, the system can read receipts, organise them
        into clear groups and store them safely. This gives you more time to focus on your work
        instead of worrying about bookwork.

        <h2>Our Service Plans</h2>
        <p>
            EZ-Accounting has three main plans. Each plan suits a different type of customer. You can
            start with the smallest plan and switch to another plan later if your business grows or
            you need more features. Every plan includes secure online access and simple email help.
        </p>

            <h3>Basic Plan</h3>
            <p>
                The Basic plan is for people who are just starting a small business or side job. It
                helps you record simple money in and money out. You can see a list of what you have
                spent and what you have earned without using paper or a calculator.
            </p>
            <p>Optional features for the Basic plan:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Let up to two people upload photos of receipts from their phones.</li>
                <li>Add a simple tax summary for small Australian businesses.</li>
                <li>Connect one small online shop, such as Etsy or Shopify.</li>
            </ul>
        </article>

        <article>
            <h3>Standard Plan</h3>
            <p>
                The Standard plan is for small but busy businesses. It is useful when you send and
                receive a lot of payments each week. The system helps you see who has paid, who still
                needs to pay, and where most of your money is going.
            </p>
            <p>Optional features for the Standard plan:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Use a ready-made set of money categories for your type of business.</li>
                <li>Turn on a simple approval step before large payments are made.</li>
                <li>View basic summaries for more than one store or location at once.</li>
            </ul>
        </article>

        <article>
            <h3>Pro Plan</h3>
            <p>
                The Pro plan is for groups or teams that talk about money regularly, such as once a
                month in a meeting. It creates clear summary pages that show what has changed since
                last month so you can quickly see if things are getting better or worse.
            </p>
            <p>Optional features for the Pro plan:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Create simple budgets and compare them with what really happened.</li>
                <li>Automatically make monthly summary files you can print or email.</li>
                <li>Get faster setup help and priority email support from EZ-Accounting staff.</li>
